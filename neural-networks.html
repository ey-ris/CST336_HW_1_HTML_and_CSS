            <p>Neural networks are a series of algorithms that mimic the operations of a human brain to recognize
                relationships between vast amounts of data. They are the foundation of deep learning and are
                particularly useful for recognizing patterns in data.</p>

            <h2>How Neural Networks Work</h2>
            <p>A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). Each connection has a weight that
                adjusts as learning proceeds. The network learns by adjusting these weights based on the errors it makes
                in its predictions.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>Deep learning uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to learn increasingly abstract
                    features from the data.</p>
