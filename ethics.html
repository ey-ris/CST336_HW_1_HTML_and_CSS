            <h2>Key Ethical Concerns</h2>
            <h3>Bias and Fairness</h3>
            <p>AI systems can perpetuate or amplify biases present in their training data, leading to unfair outcomes
                for certain groups.</p>

            <h3>Privacy</h3>
            <p>The massive data requirements of AI systems raise concerns about personal privacy and data protection.
            </p>

            <h3>Accountability</h3>
            <p>When AI systems make decisions, it can be difficult to determine who is responsible for those decisions.
            </p>

            <h3>Job Displacement</h3>
            <p>The automation potential of AI raises concerns about widespread job losses and economic disruption.</p>
